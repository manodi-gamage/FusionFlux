The website makes the lives of tourists that visit Sri Lanka easy. We want to add page for tourists to chat with an AI bot about Sri Lanka.

Create a new page for an AI chatbot. Instead of using a library, use axios to requests to the openai endpoint. The tourist should be able to have a multi-turn conversation.
Create a simple and easy to use UI using shadcn components.

I have already implemented some part of it. But, it does not work correctly. I want you to analyze the existing code and make the necessary chages.

Improve the chat interface in terms of user experience and design. It should render the markdown text correctly as well. The current UI is too simplistic. Make it little more fancy and user friendly.
